# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: import maths
### Step 2:  type the values of the given matrix
### Step 3: use math.sqrt for to get the distance between two points
Substitute the values in the distance formula  
### Step 4: use print function 
### Step 5:run the program
